      <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
      <h3>
        <p> Hi, I'm Camille Converse. I'm 17. I'm a senior at Jackson Christian School. I live in Brownsville, TN. Before that I lived in Asheville, NC. I was born there, and lived there with my mom until I was 5. My mom married my dad Clark and we moved
          to Brownsville. I went to Haywood County Schools and met my best friend Rebecca Davis. We've been friends for 10 years now.
          <p> I have several hobbies. I like to paint and I'm currently crocheting my first blanket. During the summer, I volunteer as a camp counsler. The camp is called Camp Bratton Green and is located in Canton, MS. Below is the group picture from one
            of my sessions this summer. You can find me in the middle back. Something I'd really like to do more is travel. March of this year, a group of us took a trip to Scotland and Ireland. I loved it so much. I'm even planning on studying abroad
            in Scotland once I get to college.
