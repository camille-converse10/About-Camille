    <p> I started crocheting at the end of July. I had knitted before but not crocheted. What had inspied me to start crochetng was seeing someone crochet a temperature blanket. I didn't know what it was at the time I just love the colors. So I asked her
      how she chose the colors and she explained to me that it was a temperature blanket. </h3>

      <h2>Temperature Blanket</h2>
      <p>
        <h3> A temperature blanket (TB) is a blanket that's colors are based upon the weather. The creator chooses a set amout of time to make the blanket. Her's was Jan-Dec of 2019. Mine is my senior year, Aug 2019-May 2020. Then they choose a color range
          based on the temperature of their area. I have 12 yarns, each representing a 5 degree increments. Lastly, they just crochet each row of the blacket based on the day's temperature and the corresponding color.

      <h2>Granny Square Blanket</h2>
      <p>
        <h3> While making my TB I got a little bored, because I could only do 1 row at a time, so I started a second project. A Granny Square Blanket is a little more difficult than my TB. A granny square uses a double crochet while my pattern for the TB just
          uses a single crochet. For a GSB (granny square blanket) you make several granny sqaures (~120 for an afgan) and crochet or sew (depending on preference/pattern) them together when you're done.
